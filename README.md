# streamlit-buffett

This contains the **"Ask the Oracle of Omaha"** Streamlit application that I built for the 2023 Snowflake Summit Streamlit Hackathon. This app took home 2nd place (https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/announcing-the-winners-of-the-summit-hackathon/43344)

The Streamlit App can be viewed here: https://jrpettus-streamlit-buffett-buffett-app-hqw5pq.streamlit.app/

Ideally, I would have cleaned this up more and got futher but work got in the way right before my wife and I had a baby...

Note I may take this down depending on costs in the future.
